# OCR-With-Read-Out-Loud-Using-Python

This is an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) System designed using Python and reads the contents out loud. 

The system takes the image file as input and runs an optical character recognition using Google Tesseract OCR Engine and analyses the text present within the image. It then saves the determined text from the image within a text file. The contents of the text file are then converted to an audio file using Google Text To Speech. The created audio file is then played. 

This is a simple OCR created using Python with an additional feature of reading the text present within the image out loud.

Required Modules The following modules are needed to be imported in Python 3.8 codebase:

OpenCV 3.2.0 (cv2): This module is used for detection of image.

Pytesseract: This module is used to run the optical character recognition on the image.

Google Text To Speech (gTTS): This module is used to convert the text to speech.

Playsound: This module is used to play the audio.
